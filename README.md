# YouTube-Comment-Scraper

A tool for extracting and searching comment data in a video. Comes with a simple CLI to help automate and tidy up the process. This project is meant to assist with data collection, as well as more mundane tasks (for that one time you scrolled for 7 minutes to find one comment).

## Installation

To clone the project, run `git clone https://github.com/adldtd/YT-Comment-Scraper`

Make sure you have NodeJS and npm installed on your computer (recommended: Node 16.16.0, npm 8.1.0). Then, using your terminal, navigate to the comment-scraper folder and run `npm init` inside. This should install all required dependencies in a folder called node_modules, and it should link the CLI to the terminal. From there, run `comment-scraper help` to get started.
